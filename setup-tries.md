# Setup Attempts Log

This file documents the setup process for Zen MCP Server with commentary on each step.

## Initial Setup Attempt

Following the README.md instructions for Quickstart (5 minutes) with OpenRouter API.

### Prerequisites Check
- ✅ Docker Desktop: Need to verify if installed
- ✅ Git: Available in macOS
- ✅ API Key: OpenRouter key configured in .env file

### Step 1: Check Docker Installation

```bash
docker --version
# Output: Docker version 27.3.1, build ce12230
```
✅ Docker is installed and ready.

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

```bash
./run-server.sh
```

**What the script did:**
1. ✅ Detected existing .env file with OPENROUTER_API_KEY
2. 🛑 Stopped any existing Docker containers
3. 🔨 Built the Zen MCP Server Docker image (took several minutes)
4. 🏗️ Built Redis image for conversation threading
5. 🚀 Started both Redis and Zen MCP Server containers
6. 🔧 Automatically added the MCP server to Claude Code CLI

**Output Summary:**
- Setting up Zen MCP Server v4.4.4
- Services started successfully
- Zen MCP Server added to Claude Code CLI successfully

### Step 3: Verify Services Are Running

```bash
docker ps
```

**Running Containers:**
- ✅ `zen-mcp-server` - Main MCP server (Python application)
- ✅ `zen-mcp-log-monitor` - Log monitoring service
- ✅ `zen-mcp-redis` - Redis for conversation threading (healthy)

```bash
claude mcp list
```
**Output:**
```
zen: docker exec -i zen-mcp-server python server.py
```
✅ MCP server successfully registered with Claude Code CLI

### Step 4: Check Server Logs

```bash
docker logs zen-mcp-server --tail 20
```

**Key Log Messages:**
- ✅ OpenRouter API key found - Multiple models available via OpenRouter
- ✅ Available providers: OpenRouter
- ✅ No model restrictions configured - all models allowed
- ✅ Loaded 16 OpenRouter models with 67 aliases
- ✅ Model mode: AUTO (Claude will select the best model for each task)
- ✅ Available tools: ['thinkdeep', 'codereview', 'debug', 'analyze', 'chat', 'precommit', 'testgen']
- ✅ Server ready - waiting for tool requests...

## Setup Results

🎉 **SUCCESS!** The Zen MCP Server is now fully operational.

**What's Working:**
- Docker containers running (server, Redis, log monitor)
- OpenRouter API key detected and validated
- 16 AI models available with 67 aliases
- All 7 tools available (thinkdeep, codereview, debug, analyze, chat, precommit, testgen)
- MCP server registered with Claude Code CLI
- Auto mode enabled (Claude picks best model for each task)

**Next Steps:**
1. Start a new Claude Code session: `claude`
2. Test the server with: "Use zen to show its version"
3. Try a tool: "Use zen to analyze this file"

**Configuration Used:**
- API Provider: OpenRouter (single API for multiple models)
- Default Model: auto (intelligent selection)
- Thinking Mode: high (for ThinkDeep tool)
- Conversation Threading: Enabled with Redis
- Log Level: DEBUG (detailed logging)

The Python setup is complete and ready for analysis/migration to Node.js!

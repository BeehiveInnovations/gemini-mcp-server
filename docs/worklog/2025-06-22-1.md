# Zenode MCP Server Docker Migration & Recovery - 2025-06-22

## Overview

This worklog documents the complete recovery from the failed "imagen dockerless" branch and implementation of a proper Docker-based MCP setup for the Zenode server. The goal was to restore a stable, Docker-based development environment focusing exclusively on MCP protocol operation.

## Background

The project had experienced issues from a long-running branch called "imagen dockerless" that had put everything into a bad state. The requirements were to:

1. Stick with Docker approach locally
2. Disable CLI mode and focus on MCP-only operation
3. Incorporate latest MCP docs and best practices
4. Ensure proper env file usage in builds
5. Properly add/remove MCP from Claude using correct methodology
6. Support both Apple Silicon (local) and Linux (remote) deployments

## Tasks Completed

### ‚úÖ 1. Research and Analysis Phase

**Research Latest MCP Documentation:**
- Reviewed Anthropic's official MCP documentation at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp
- Identified key best practices for MCP server development and Docker configurations
- Found critical info about stdio transport, environment variables, and server management

**Codebase Analysis:**
- Identified problematic CLI mode implementation in `src/index.ts`
- Found CLI mode detection code causing conflicts with MCP-only operation
- Located functions `runCliMode()` and `startZenode()` requiring modification

**Reference Implementation Study:**
- Analyzed GitHub issue #35: API key configuration problems requiring container rebuilds
- Reviewed PR #80: Docker setup and file handling implementations  
- Studied PatrykIti/zen-mcp-server for Python Docker patterns

### ‚úÖ 2. Codebase Cleanup

**Disabled CLI Mode:**
- Commented out entire `runCliMode()` function (lines 604-691) in `src/index.ts`
- Modified `startZenode()` to only run MCP server mode, removing CLI detection
- Added clear documentation about why CLI mode was disabled
- Preserved CLI code as comments for potential future reference

**Removed Legacy Containers:**
- Identified and cleaned up old "zenode-server" references in docker-compose.yml
- Updated service names from `zenode-server` to `zenode` for clarity
- Fixed container dependency references in log-monitor service

### ‚úÖ 3. Docker Infrastructure Overhaul

**Multi-Architecture Dockerfile Creation:**

**Main Dockerfile (Dockerfile):**
- Multi-stage build using Node.js 20 Alpine
- Build stage with TypeScript compilation and dependency installation
- Production stage with minimal runtime footprint
- Non-root user security (zenode:zenode, uid 1001)
- Proper volume mounting for `/workspace` and `/tmp/zenode-logs`
- Health check using simple Node.js process check

**Apple Silicon Dockerfile (Dockerfile.arm64):**
- Optimized for ARM64 architecture using `arm64v8/node:20-alpine`
- Platform-specific dependency installation with `--arch=arm64`
- Environment variables indicating Apple Silicon optimization
- Specific labels for ARM64 platform identification

**Linux Production Dockerfile (Dockerfile.linux):**
- Optimized for AMD64 architecture using `amd64/node:20-alpine`
- Enhanced security with CA certificates and minimal permissions
- Production environment variables with memory optimization
- Extended health checks and security metadata

**Docker Compose Updates:**
- Removed obsolete `version: '3.8'` directive (Docker Compose now infers version)
- Updated service name from `zenode-server` to `zenode`
- Fixed container name from `zenode-server` to `zenode-mcp`
- Updated dependency references in log-monitor service
- Changed health check from CLI command to simple Node.js check (avoiding CLI mode)

### ‚úÖ 4. Build Automation

**Multi-Platform Build Script (docker-build.sh):**
- Executable shell script with comprehensive build options
- Support for local, Apple Silicon, Linux, and multi-arch builds
- Colored output and error handling
- Automatic .env file validation and creation
- Usage instructions and examples
- Docker buildx setup for multi-platform builds

**Environment Configuration:**
- Updated `.env.example` with comprehensive documentation
- Added Docker-specific environment variables
- Included Redis connection settings for containers
- Security best practices documentation
- Build command examples and deployment notes

### ‚úÖ 5. Container Build and Deployment

**Build Process:**
- Successfully cleaned up 26.56GB of Docker cache and orphaned containers
- Built zenode-mcp:latest container using new multi-stage Dockerfile  
- Verified TypeScript compilation and dependency installation
- Confirmed non-root user setup and proper file permissions

**Container Deployment:**
- Started Redis, zenode-mcp, and log-monitor containers using docker-compose
- Verified all containers are running and healthy
- Identified Redis connection issue (connection refused) but confirmed zenode container is responsive
- Container shows "healthy" status despite Redis connectivity warnings

### ‚úÖ 6. MCP Integration

**Proper MCP Server Registration:**
- Removed legacy `zenode-server` MCP entry from Claude Code
- Added new `zenode-docker` MCP server using proper docker exec command:
  ```bash
  claude mcp add zenode-docker --scope local -e REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0 -e NODE_ENV=production -e MCP_WORKSPACE=/workspace -- docker exec -i zenode-mcp node dist/index.js
  ```
- Configured with appropriate environment variables for Docker operation
- Used local scope for project-specific configuration

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
1. **Docker Infrastructure**: Multi-architecture Dockerfiles and compose setup
2. **Container Build**: Successful compilation and image creation
3. **Container Deployment**: All services running and healthy
4. **MCP Registration**: Properly added to Claude Code with docker exec transport
5. **CLI Mode Removal**: Successfully disabled problematic CLI functionality

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
1. **Redis Connection**: Zenode container cannot connect to Redis service
   - Error: `ECONNREFUSED` when trying to connect to `redis://redis:6379/0`
   - Redis container is healthy and accepting connections
   - This appears to be a networking issue between containers
   - **Impact**: Limited - zenode is responsive and MCP functionality should work without Redis

### üß™ Testing Status
- Container responsiveness: ‚úÖ Verified with `docker exec zenode-mcp node -e "console.log('Zenode container is responsive')"`
- MCP server registration: ‚úÖ Successfully added to Claude Code
- End-to-end MCP functionality: ‚è≥ Testing in progress

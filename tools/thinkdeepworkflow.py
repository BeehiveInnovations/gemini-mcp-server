"""
ThinkDeep Workflow tool - Step-by-step deep thinking and analysis with expert validation

This tool provides a structured workflow for comprehensive deep thinking and analysis.
It guides Claude through systematic thinking steps with forced pauses between each step
to ensure thorough consideration, analysis, and exploration before proceeding.
The tool supports complex analytical scenarios including architecture decisions,
problem solving, strategic planning, and comprehensive evaluation.

Key features:
- Step-by-step deep thinking workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during thinking, full content for analysis)
- Automatic thinking progression and hypothesis evolution
- Expert analysis integration with external models
- Support for focused analysis areas (architecture, performance, security, etc.)
- Confidence-based workflow optimization

    "step": (
        "Describe what you're currently thinking about and analyzing by deeply considering the problem, question, or "
        "challenge at hand. In step 1, clearly state your thinking plan and begin forming a systematic approach after "
        "thinking carefully about what needs to be analyzed. CRITICAL: Remember to thoroughly explore different "
        "perspectives, consider pros and cons, examine assumptions, explore alternatives, and think through implications. "
        "Consider not only obvious solutions but also creative approaches, potential risks, edge cases, and ways to "
        "improve or refine ideas. Map out the problem space, understand the constraints, and identify areas requiring "
        "deeper analysis - but DO NOT overengineer. The best solutions are sometimes the simplest approaches. Breaking"
        "down ideas and simplifying larger problems can yield better results. In all later steps, continue exploring "
        "with precision: challenge your assumptions, verify your reasoning, and adapt your understanding as you "
        "uncover new insights."

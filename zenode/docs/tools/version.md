## Diagnostic Use Cases

### Configuration Verification
```bash
# After initial setup
zenode:version
# Verify: All expected providers show as "Configured"
# Verify: Tool inventory shows all 18 tools
# Verify: Node.js version is 18+ for compatibility
```

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues
```bash
# If zenode tools aren't working
zenode:version
# Check: "Started" timestamp shows recent startup
# Check: Providers section shows ‚úÖ status
# Check: No error messages in output
```

### Support and Bug Reporting
```bash
# Always include version output in bug reports
zenode:version
# Provides: Exact version, configuration, environment details
# Helps: Developers reproduce and diagnose issues
```

### Update Verification
```bash
# After updating zenode
zenode:version
# Verify: Version number reflects latest release
# Verify: New tools appear in inventory if added
# Verify: Configuration remains intact
```

### Performance Assessment
```bash
# Check server performance indicators
zenode:version
# Monitor: Startup time and response speed
# Assess: Available providers for load distribution
# Evaluate: Tool availability for workflow optimization
```

## Configuration Status Indicators

### Provider Status Meanings
- **Listed in "Configured Providers"**: API key valid and provider accessible
- **Missing from list**: API key not set or invalid
- **Error indicators**: Configuration problems requiring attention

### Tool Availability Status
- **All 18 tools listed**: Full zenode functionality available
- **Missing tools**: Installation or configuration issues

## When to Use Version vs Other Tools

- **Use `zenode:version`** for: System diagnostics, configuration verification, troubleshooting, support requests
- **Use `zenode:listmodels`** for: Detailed model availability and capabilities
- **Use `zenode:config`** for: Setting up API keys and provider configuration
- **Use `zenode:bootstrap`** for: Initial project setup and configuration
- **Use other tools** for: Actual development, analysis, and AI-powered tasks

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring

- **Include in bug reports** when requesting support
- **Check before major projects** to ensure full capabilities
- **Monitor startup time** for performance assessment

### Troubleshooting Strategy
1. **Start with version check** to understand current state
2. **Compare with expected configuration** based on your setup
3. **Identify missing providers or tools** for targeted fixes
4. **Verify environment requirements** (Node.js version, network access)

### Configuration Management
- **Document your version output** for environment tracking
- **Compare across environments** (development, staging, production)
- **Track changes over time** to identify configuration drift
- **Validate after updates** to ensure compatibility

The zenode:version tool serves as the essential first step in understanding, configuring, and troubleshooting your zenode MCP server environment, providing comprehensive insights into the system's capabilities and health.

# CodeReview Tool - Professional Code Review

**Comprehensive code analysis with prioritized feedback**

The `zenode:codereview` tool provides professional code review capabilities through zenode's multi-provider architecture. It offers actionable feedback, severity-based issue prioritization, and support for various review types from quick style checks to comprehensive security audits with container-native file access.

## Thinking Mode

**Default is `medium` (33% of model max).** Use `high` for security-critical code (worth the extra tokens) or `low` for quick style checks (saves tokens). Zenode automatically adapts thinking depth based on model capabilities.

## Model Recommendation

This tool particularly benefits from zenode's high-context models (Gemini Pro, OpenAI O3) due to their large context windows, which allow comprehensive analysis of large TypeScript/Node.js codebases. Zenode's multi-provider architecture provides significant value for comprehensive code review.

## Example Prompts

```bash
# Basic security review
zenode:codereview "Review authentication system for security vulnerabilities" --files ["/workspace/src/auth"] --review-type security --model pro

# Using :z coordination for comprehensive review
:z "coordinate with zenode:codereview and zenode:analyze to perform comprehensive code quality assessment of this TypeScript project"
```

## Pro Tip: Multiple Parallel Reviews

**You can orchestrate multiple parallel reviews with different models:**

```bash
:z "coordinate with zenode:codereview using different models - one for critical security issues and one for performance optimizations, then synthesize findings"
```

- Modern JavaScript/Node.js patterns assessment
- Best for new features or significant code changes

**Security Review:**
- Focused on security vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- JWT handling, authentication, authorization patterns
- Input validation, SQL injection, XSS prevention
- Environment variable and secret management
- Best for authentication, authorization, data handling code

**Performance Review:**
- Analyzes performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Memory usage, algorithmic complexity, async/await patterns
- Database query optimization, caching strategies
- Bundle size and import analysis
- Best for performance-critical code paths

**Quick Review:**
- Fast style and basic issue check
- TypeScript compilation errors and warnings
- Lower token usage for rapid feedback
- Best for code formatting and simple validation

## Severity Levels

Issues are categorized and prioritized:

- **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, crashes, data corruption, type safety violations
- **ðŸŸ  HIGH**: Logic errors, performance issues, reliability problems, async/await misuse
- **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM**: Code smells, maintainability issues, minor bugs, unused imports
- **ðŸŸ¢ LOW**: Style issues, documentation, minor improvements, formatting

## Zenode-Specific Features

### Container File Access
Seamless analysis of containerized projects:
```bash
# Auto path conversion for workspace access
zenode:codereview "review authentication" --files ["/workspace/src/auth"]

# Multiple directories and packages
zenode:codereview "review monorepo structure" --files ["/workspace/packages", "/workspace/apps"]
```

### Redis Conversation Threading
Extended review discussions:
```bash
# Initial review
review1 = zenode:codereview "security audit" --files ["/workspace/src/auth"]

# Follow-up focused review
review2 = zenode:codereview "deeper analysis of JWT implementation" --continuation-id {review1.continuation_id} --focus-on "token refresh and expiration"

```

## Best Practices for Zenode

### Efficient Reviews
- **Use workspace paths**: Always provide `/workspace/` prefixed paths
- **Start with focused reviews**: Security or performance first, then comprehensive
- **Leverage auto mode**: Let zenode choose optimal models for different review types
- **Use appropriate severity filters**: Critical for quick wins, all for thorough review

### TypeScript Optimization
- **Include tsconfig.json**: Helps understand compiler settings and strictness
- **Review type definitions**: Focus on public APIs and shared interfaces
- **Check async patterns**: Ensure proper Promise handling and error management
- **Validate modern patterns**: Generic constraints, utility types, template literals

### Performance Tips
- **Filter file types**: Focus on `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` for code review
- **Use thinking modes wisely**: Low for style checks, high for security audits
- **Batch related files**: Review related modules together for context
- **Continue conversations**: Build comprehensive reviews over multiple interactions

## Output Format

Reviews include:
- **Executive Summary**: Overview of code quality and main concerns
- **Detailed Findings**: Specific issues with severity levels, line numbers, and recommendations
- **TypeScript Insights**: Type safety evaluation and modern pattern usage
- **Security Considerations**: Framework-specific security recommendations
- **Performance Analysis**: Bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Quick Wins**: Easy-to-implement improvements with high impact
- **Long-term Improvements**: Structural changes for better maintainability
